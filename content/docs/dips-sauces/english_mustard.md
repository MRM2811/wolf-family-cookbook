## INGREDIENTS:
* 2 tablespoons mustard seeds
* 4 tablespoons mustard powder (Coleman's)
* 1⁄4 cup water
* 1⁄2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
* 1⁄2 teaspoon turmeric powder
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1⁄2 teaspoon honey
* 1⁄2 teaspoon vinegar
* 1⁄4 cup cold beer (Your preference)

## DIRECTIONS:
1. Toast the mustard seeds in a small dry pan (I use a cast iron pan) over medium heat, shaking occasionally, until the seeds start to pop. Remove from heat and tip the seeds into a mortar and pestle and crush them a few times. (If you don't have a mortar and pestle, tip them into a bowl and use the back of a spoon to crush them).
1. In a glass or pottery bowl, blend the crushed mustard seeds, mustard powder and water thoroughly and let stand for 20 minutes. (You can drink the remaining beer while you're waiting!).
1. Add the cayenne pepper, tumeric powder and salt. Stir to combine, then add the honey, vinegar and beer.
1. If the mixture seems too thin, add up to one more tablespoon of mustard powder to help thicken it.
1. Pour mustard into a small jar, cover and refrigerate for 2 to 3 days before using to let the flavors combine.
