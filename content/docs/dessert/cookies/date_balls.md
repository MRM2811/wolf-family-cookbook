Recipe from [Beyond Frosting](https://beyondfrosting.com/coconut-krispie-date-balls/)

## Ingredients:

* 11 ounces (311g) dates, chopped
* 1 cup (226g) unsalted butter
* 1 ½ cups (285g) granulated sugar
* 2 large eggs, slightly beaten
* 1 tablespoons (15ml) milk
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 6 cups (160g) Rice Krispie cereal (or similar cereal)
* 1 bag (7 ounces/ 198g) sweetened shredded coconut

## Directions:

1. Remove pits and chop dates into small pieces, about the size of a dime. Dates are very sticky, if you have latex gloves, I would suggest using them.
1. In a large saucepan, melt butter and sugar together, stirring occasionally until the butter is melted.
1. Turn the heat to low and add chopped dates and cook until mixture is boiling, about 15 to 20 minutes. Stir frequently to prevent mixture from burning.
1. In a separate bowl, combine eggs, milk and vanilla extract. Once the mixture is boiling, take about ¼ cup of the mixture and pour it into the eggs, and whisk constantly to temper the eggs.
1. Remove the saucepan from the stovetop and pour the egg mixture back into the saucepan. You will want to work quickly so they do not become scrambled.
1. Return mixture to the stovetop and boil for about 5 minutes, stirring frequently. Remove the mixture from the heat. In a large mixing bowl, combine rice cereal with date mixture and stir until evenly coated. Allow the mixture to cool until it can be handled.
1. Shape date mixture into balls (1 to 2 tablespoons in size) and place on a sheet pan. For a higher yield, reduce the size of the balls.
1. Place the shredded coconut in a separate bowl and roll each date ball (one at a time) in the shredded coconut, gently pressing coconut into the dates. Refrigerate the date balls for one hour. Store in an airtight container and keep refrigerated or frozen.
