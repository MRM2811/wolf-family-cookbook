## Ingredients (10-inch bundt pan)

### The Bread

* 1 1/4 cups milk
* 2 tsp instant yeast
* 4 cups flour
* 5 Tbsp sugar
* 1 tsp salt
* 1 egg
* 5 Tbsp unsalted butter, melted

### The Cinnamon Sugar Coating

* 1 1/4 cups packed brown sugar
* 2 tsp cinnamon
* 1/2 cup (1 stick or 8 Tbsp) unsalted butter, melted

## Directions

## The Bread

Liberally spray a 10-inch bundt pan with nonstick cooking spray.
Place milk in microwave-safe liquid measuring cup and microwave for 45 seconds or until lukewarm, but not hot. Add yeast and whisk to combine. (Do not heat milk above 110 degrees or you will kill the yeast.)
In a large bowl and with an electric mixer and paddle attachment combine the flour, sugar and salt.
Add egg and mix to combine.
Add the milk and yeast mixture followed by the 5 Tbsp melted butter and mix until combined.
Switch mixer attachment from paddle to dough hook and mix on medium speed for 8-10 minutes or until dough mounds together but is not sticky. Dough should form easily into a ball and pull away from bowl.
Spray a large bowl with nonstick cooking spray and place dough into the bowl. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and place it in a warm area to rest until doubled in size, about 1 hour.
Punch down the dough with your hands. Use a clean kitchen scissor to cut the dough into 1-1 1/2 inch pieces. Roll the pieces into rough balls and place balls on a baking sheet and cover with plastic wrap.

## The Cinnamon Sugar Coating and to Assemble the Bread

Combine ingredients for cinnamon sugar coating in a small bowl. Melt 1 stick of unsalted butter in a separate bowl or liquid measuring cup.
Dip each piece of dough into the butter, allow excess to drip back into the bowl, then drop dough balls into bowl of cinnamon sugar and roll to coat. Place coated pieces of dough into bundt pan.
Wrap bundt pan in plastic wrap and again, set the pan in a warm place and allow the dough balls to raise and double in size, about 1 hour.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Remove plastic wrap from pan and bake for 30 minutes.
Let cool 5 minutes in pan and then invert onto serving dish. Serve warm.

> NOTE: Dough can be made a day ahead and stored in refrigerator until ready to bake. To do this, after dipping dough balls into butter and cinnamon sugar, cover pan with plastic wrap and store in the refrigerator. Remove pan and let it come to room temperature before baking.
